ABOUT THE PROJECT
The aim of this project was to demonstrate how to create a dashboard in Power BI, taking as a baseline the results of a survey made to professionals working on Data Science (analysts, scientists, data engineers, developpers…). The survey collects data on country of origin, gender, preferred programming languages, annual salary…

I have tried to used the most convenient type of graph for each type of data and I have tried to adapt the colors in order to make the design attractive and to express the correct message.

DATA SOURCE
The data for this project have been provided by Alex Freberg (known as @Alex The Analyst), an experienced data analyst that administers a youtube channel to teach Data Analysis. You can download the source data from his GIT.

Some keypoints of the dashboard:

The graphs have been adapted to the type of data:
cards for single data (number of respondents, average age),
treemaps for the country of origin to make the proportions visible and make possible to play with the country of origin (the ordinary maps were not as useful)
Gauges for data such as happiness with salary or with work/life balance
The colours have been adapted to be attractive (although I am not a graphic designer) and to the message that I needed to transmit:
The colour palette is based on a recommendation from THIS BLOG POST (external) especially focused on colour palettes for business dashboards
For the gauges and for the donut chart on difficulty to start your career, it has been used a progressive palette red to green (dark-red the worst, dark-green the best)
I have also adapted the dashboard to mobile phones and smaller screens, created a second view for such devices.
